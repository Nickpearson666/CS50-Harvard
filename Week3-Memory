Thanks Pro David 
Here are somrthing I  learnt from CS50

1.RGB are represented by 16. eg:R(FF)G(00)B(00), this color is red

2.point are 8 bytes

3.Stirng is actually  a set  of char and an address

4.Different memory = Different string

5.we could use malloc to avoid this question but remember to free afer using it.

6.Heap is where I can get some memory form ,eg malloc

7.Stack is where I could store some local variable in main and function
