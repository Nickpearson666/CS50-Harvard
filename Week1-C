Here are something I learnt from CS50 From Harvard University.
Thanks Professor David.

1. ASCII refers to American standard code for Information

2. souce(eg:c)--->compiler--->machine code(eg:101010).

3.'/' slash , '%s',place holder in C.

4.When we use printf to print a string, this function will find the '\0' inn the end.

string is acutually an array, which store a list of chars.

5.In C, main function could use perimeter: int argv, argv[]. argv[0] is the name of the progarm and argv[1] is the real perimeter.

6.Î© stands the best case of the progarm. eg, for binary search is 1.

7.Recursion is the way to divide a problem into smaller pieces, which contanins base case and loop.

8.For merge sort, the average is O(n*logn). n means the time of merge and logn means the number of dividing.
